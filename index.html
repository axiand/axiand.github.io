        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I'm a hobbyist programmer who likes to work on things in his spare time. I mainly work with (Node)JS for backend apps and pure HTML+CSS+JS for the web but I'm open to trying out new things every so often.</p><br>
        <p>In the past I've worked on Discord bots, a few web games / tools, and some other small things. I enjoy looking for bugs in software and modifying it to suit my own needs.</p><br>
        <p>I have a virtually endless backlog of ideas to work through, so there's always more on the plate for me.</p>
